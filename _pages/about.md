I am a statistics postdocoral researcher at the University of Glasgow with interests in spatial statistics, statistical ecology, Bayesian inference and model assessment.

In general, I am interested in how we can use statistics to answer scientific questions, help make decisions, explore data and direct future research efforts.  I am particularly interested in applications in ecology and conservation.
