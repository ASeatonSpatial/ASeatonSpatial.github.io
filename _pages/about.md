I am a statistics PhD student at the University of St Andrews with interests in spatial statistics, statistical ecology, Bayesian inference and model assessment.  

In general I am interested in how we can use statistics to answer scientific questions, help make decisions, explore data and direct future research efforts.  I am particularly interested in applications in ecology and conservation but also in the understanding the fundamental principles by which we conduct analysis to ensure we make sensible and robust claims based on available data.
